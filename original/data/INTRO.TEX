INTRODUCTION

This program will attempt to teach you some mechanics. Mechanics is a branch of physics which is concerned with the relation of matter to energy.

You will be presented with six chapters, any of which you may attempt. Each chapter has some pages of text which explain the subject matter.

After you have read a chapter you will be asked to try and answer some questions on that chapter. Reinforcement text will be supplied if required.

At the end of your session, a breakdown of marks for each chapter attempted will be displayed, together with an overall percentage mark.

You may choose to attempt as many or as few chapters as you wish in any one session.

USING THIS PROGRAM

When a chapter is selected from the menu, the text for that chapter will be displayed a page at a time. When you have read each page, you will be prompted to continue.

After the text has been presented, you will be asked a number of multiple-choice questions on the chapter. You should answer each question by typing the letter corresponding to your chosen answer.

If your answer is correct, you will be told so and the program will continue to the next question. If your answer is incorrect, you will be shown the correct answer and given some reinforcement text explaining it.

You may return to the menu and choose another chapter at any time, or you may choose to end the session.
