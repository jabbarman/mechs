# CHAPTER#01 — Force of Gravity, Weight and Friction

## Introduction

Gravitation is the force by which bodies are attracted towards each other. It is responsible for keeping the Moon in its orbit about the Earth and also the Earth and its fellow planets in their orbits round the Sun.

In circular motion, an object is kept in its path by a force directed towards the centre of the circle. Such forces are called centripetal forces. Gravitation provides the centripetal force which keeps the planets in orbit.

## Weight

Weight is the name given to the force due to gravity on a mass. It has been shown that on the Earth the force of gravity on a mass of one kilogram is approximately [[uncertain: 9.8]] newtons. Thus the weight of one kilogram mass is approximately [[uncertain: 9.8]] N.

The weight of an object depends on the strength of the gravitational field in which it is placed. On the Moon, for example, the gravitational field is weaker than on the Earth, so the same mass has a smaller weight.

## Friction

When two surfaces are in contact and one tries to move over the other, a force called friction acts between them. Friction always acts in such a way as to oppose the motion or the attempted motion.

There are two main types of friction:

- **Static friction**, which acts when there is no relative motion between the surfaces.
- **Dynamic (or kinetic) friction**, which acts when the surfaces are moving relative to each other.

Static friction can take any value up to a maximum, depending on the force trying to cause motion. Once this maximum value is exceeded, the object will begin to move and dynamic friction will act instead.

## Uses and Effects of Friction

Friction can be useful. For example, without friction it would not be possible to walk, to grip objects, or for a car to move or stop.

Friction can also be a nuisance. It causes wear of moving parts and results in energy being wasted as heat. For this reason, friction is often reduced by lubrication or by using ball bearings.
