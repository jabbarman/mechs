## Summary

The use of computers in teaching is almost thirty years old. If this
present generation was not educated by them, then the next will
certainly be educated through Computer Aided Learning (CAL).

What exactly CAL is and its development up to the present is briefly
discussed in the introduction. The variety of CAL systems in use, and
how in fact they are used, follows this. After the introduction, the
objectives of this project as stated at its conception are laid out. The
next section reports on the implementation details. This includes the
hardware and software used and the way the software was developed.

Testing of MECHS, the name of the program, was an ongoing process during
development and the results were used to tailor the program to suit user
needs. The nature of these tests and the major changes initiated by the
test results are outlined in the report.

The conclusions to be drawn, and the recommendations, are the final
parts of the report.
