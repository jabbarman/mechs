# MECHS Project Documentation (1987)

This is a markdown reconstruction of the original Computer-Assisted Learning project documentation written in February-April 1987 by S J Jabbar at The Polytechnic of Wales.

## About This Reconstruction

The original documentation has been transcribed from scanned PDF pages into markdown format for easier reading and navigation. The canonical scanned PDF is available as [`MECHS_merged_canonical.pdf`](../MECHS_merged_canonical.pdf).

## Reading Order

Please read the documentation in the following order to understand the project as originally presented:

### Main Report
1. **[Front Matter](front-matter.md)** - Title page, dedication, acknowledgements
2. **[Report](report.md)** - The main project report documenting design, implementation, and evaluation
3. **[References](references.md)** - Bibliography and cited works

### Appendices
4. **[Appendix 0: Introduction](appendix-0-intro.md)** - Program introduction screen text
5. **[Appendix 1: User Guide](appendix-1-user-guide.md)** - Instructions for using the program
6. **Appendix 2: Flowcharts** - *(To be added)*
7. **[Appendix 3: Listings](appendix-3-listings.md)** - Source code listings with commentary
8. **[INTRO.TEX](intro-tex.md)** - Original introduction data file
9. **[Chapter 01: Force of Gravity, Weight and Friction](chapter01-force-of-gravity-weight-and-friction.md)** - Sample chapter content

### Supporting Materials
- **[listings_images/](listings_images/)** - Screenshots of source code from the original documentation

## Context

This documentation describes the original 1987 implementation of MECHS, a terminal-based Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL) system for teaching O-level mechanics. The program was written in Pascal for CP/M systems.

The modern implementation (in the main repository) is a complete architectural rewrite using contemporary Pascal practices while preserving the educational philosophy and approach described in this documentation.

## Historical Significance

This project represents:
- Educational software development practices of the 1980s
- Terminal-based user interface design
- Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL) pedagogical approaches
- Pascal programming style and conventions of the era
- The transition from mainframe to personal computer education

## Note

The reconstruction attempts to preserve the original content faithfully. Any transcription errors or unclear sections are noted in the individual files where appropriate.
