# INTRO.TEX — Introduction

This program will attempt to teach you some mechanics. Mechanics is a branch of physics which is concerned with the relation of matter to energy.

You will be presented with six chapters, any of which you may attempt. Each chapter has some pages of text which explain the subject matter. After you have read the chapter you will be asked to try and answer some questions on the chapter. Reinforcement text will be supplied if required.

At the end of your session, a breakdown of marks for each chapter attempted will be displayed, together with an overall percentage mark.

You may choose to attempt as many or as few chapters as you wish in any one session.
